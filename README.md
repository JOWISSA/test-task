# test-task


Basic JavaScript and HTML test
Review

The purpose of the application is to allow end users to quickly enter and manage a list of name/value pairs.

Although this test should be written without assistance, any standard reference material that is used during a normal programming cycle (such as online help or books) can be used. It is forbidden to use third party class libraries or code snippets other than jQuery.

Create an HTML application using a user interface similar to the one shown below. Application code must be written in HTML and JavaScript.




In addition, the user interface must adapt to the size of the screen on which it is viewed. For example, when viewed on a mobile phone (i.e. iPhone), the page should automatically adjust to better present the layout. This also applies to resizing the browser on a desktop and viewing a page on a tablet.

Required features:

Name/Value pairs must be entered in the top text field. This text field will be used by the end user to quickly add Name/Value pairs to the list below.

When a name/value pair is about to be added to a list, it must be checked to ensure it has the correct syntax. If the syntax is incorrect, then the Name/Value pair cannot be added. The input format of the Name/Value pair is shown below:
<name> = <value>

Where <name> is the name part of the pair and <value> is the part of the value pair. You can only add valid Name/Value pairs. Names and values can only contain alphanumeric characters. The equals sign is used to separate the pair, spaces before and/or after the equals sign may be entered by the end user (and should be ignored).

When you click the Sort By Name button, the list will be sorted in ascending order by name.

Clicking the Sort By Value button will sort the list in ascending order of value.

When you click the "Delete" button, all selected items in the list will be deleted.

When the "Show as XML" button is clicked, all the items in the list must be translated into XML format and rendered to the user in some way.


general information

Make any changes/additions you think are necessary to improve the usability of this app. Some descriptions (such as "Display as XML") are intentionally vague to allow you to make your own design/implementation decisions. Keep code clean, well organized and well commented. The quality of the application should be at the same level as for a paying client/employer.
